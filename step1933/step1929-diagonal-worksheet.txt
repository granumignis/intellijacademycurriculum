How do we get from 2,2 to 3,1

Add 1 to i
subtract 1 from j

both are known at the time it is populated

middle is a constant
middle for i is the same as middle for j
it is 2 in both cases

so, statement wise - I can get from 2,2 to 3,1 like...

if (i == 2 + 1 && j == 2 - 1)

if (i == middle + 1 && j == middle - 1)

keep in mind, when the row is created - these vars are in play
m = 2 [ constant ]
i = 3
j = 1

if (i == middle + j && j == middle - j)

if (i == 2 + 1 && j == 2 - 1)


Okay, I think this works for this one instance

turns out it only works for this one instance

another goal would be 4,0
how do we get from 3,1 to 4,0?

how do we turn this into a pattern?
