/*

Given an odd number n, not exceeding 15.

Create a two-dimensional array (matrix) from nÃ—n elements, by filling it with "." symbols
(each element of the matrix is a string containing a single symbol).


Then fill:

    The middle row of the matrix
        Divide the length of the current array by 2
            Remove the remainder from the result (maybe just store as an int to drop it)
            [ length of the current array ] - [ result of division and dropping ] = the middle row

    The middle column


    The main and the secondary diagonals

with the "*" symbols.






As a result, all "*"s in the array must form the star figure.
Output this matrix; elements of the array should be space separated.
