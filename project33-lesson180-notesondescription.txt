Write a class that represents the Coffee Machine [ Already exists ]

The class should have a method that takes a string as an input [ Already exists: 'inputLoop' ]

This method should be invoked every time the user inputs a line to the console.

The class should only handle input that comes to it via the inputLoop method and it's argument.

An enum should be created to represent the current state of the coffee machine.

The current state will help to inform the program as to what to do each time the user passes a string into the inputLoop method.

Idea for program flow

Program starts in requestAction
inputLoop sees this and runs the requestInput function
it uses the result to determine the next function to run


===


the requestInput function

This is the method that takes a string as an input


==

Another rethink of the program

==

The main program loop (input loop) just requests input and passes it to requestInput
It of course starts by asking for the next action.
requestinput takes the action and basically acts as the 'main brancher' for the program

draw or write out a clear picture of how the logic should work
